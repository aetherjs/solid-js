## OOP Playground

**S.O.L.I.D.** STANDS FOR:

### Single responsibility principle

> ðŸ“˜ A module should be responsible for only one actor. As a consequence, it has only one reason to change.

Example of single responsibility refactoring can be found in [todolist.js](src/todolist.js).

### Open closed principle

> ðŸ“˜ Modules should be open for extension but closed for modification.

### Liskov substitution principle

> ðŸ“˜ If you have a function, that works for a base type, it should work for a derived type

### Interface segregation principle

> ðŸ“˜ Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use

### Dependency Inversion principle

> ðŸ“˜ High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules
